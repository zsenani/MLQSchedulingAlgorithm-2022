# MLQ Scheduling Algorithm
Implements a Multilevel Queue (MLQ) scheduling algorithm with two queues, system processes queue numbered as Q1 and batch processes queue numbered as Q2.\ 
The scheduler follows a non-preemptive Shortest-Job-First (SJF) scheduling algorithm for processes in Q1 and First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm for processes in Q2.
Using Java programing language.
